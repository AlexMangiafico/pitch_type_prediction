# Pitch Type Prediction with Machine Learning

### An attempt to predict the next pitch thrown from past data and game situation.

This project aims to predict pitch types in baseball using machine learning techniques, leveraging a dataset of 700,000 pitches. Various models, including neural networks, Random Forest, and CatBoost, are trained to classify pitch types based on features such as count, pitcher tendencies, and pitch sequencing. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using cross-validation. The goal is to develop an accurate and interpretable model that can provide insights into pitch selection and decision-making in baseball.

pitch_prediction is a jupyter notebook presenting my work. data_pull gets the data and requirements is a file of required package versions.
